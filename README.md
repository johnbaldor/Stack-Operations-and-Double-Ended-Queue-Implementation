This project demonstrates skills in algorithm implementation, data structure manipulation, Java programming, and unit testing using JUnit. The tasks involve building sorting algorithms, a doubly-linked list, and a deque while optimizing for runtime efficiency and following object-oriented design principles.

DoublyLinkedList Implementation
Skills Used: Data Structures, Java Generics, Object-Oriented Design

Implemented a doubly-linked list with support for operations such as insertion, deletion, finding, and replacement of nodes.
Ensured optimized time complexities, like O(1) for insertions at the head and tail.
Used Java's object-oriented features to structure the implementation with an abstract base class and interface inheritance.

More List Methods
Skills Used: Linked-List Operations, Problem-Solving, Algorithm Design
Developed methods to find the minimum, maximum, and middle elements in a list, create deep copies, concatenate lists, merge sorted lists, and reverse a list.
Focused on designing algorithms with specific time complexities, ensuring efficient manipulation of linked-list data structures.

JUnit Testing for DoublyLinkedList
Skills Used: Test-Driven Development (TDD), Unit Testing, Debugging
Wrote comprehensive JUnit test cases covering various linked list operations, including insertion, deletion, and search.
Utilized TDD practices to ensure code reliability and handle various edge cases effectively.

Linked-List Deque Implementation
Skills Used: Data Structure Design, Queue Operations
Implemented a deque using the doubly-linked list to support O(1) operations for adding and removing elements from both ends.
Applied knowledge of queue behaviors in designing an efficient double-ended queue structure.

JUnit Testing for Deque
Skills Used: Automated Testing, Edge Case Handling
Developed JUnit tests to verify the correctness of deque operations, ensuring that both edge cases and typical use cases were covered effectively.
